In this case, you will continue to benefit from the service for which you have not communicated that you have withdrawn at the current list price.\rThe current cost for the disposal of the service is \u20ac29.95 including VAT. The cost indicated is all-inclusive and is understood as the final cost actually applied to the customer. The cost of deactivation does not vary and is independent of the technology, the mode of withdrawal (termination or migration to another operator) and the title of possession of the modem. The cost for the disposal of the service includes the costs related to administrative management and technical implementation incurred by the operator for the termination/migration of the line. The cost applied by Fastweb is the lower of the costs actually incurred for the disposal/transfer of the user and the value of the contract.\rIn the event of early withdrawal in the first 12 months, SKY may charge an amount equal to the discounts used for each package/service in addition to a fixed cost of \u20ac11.53, as an operator cost for the recovery of the decoder.

  "Now the particular challenge we want to explore here is what's happening as a result of digital technologies. We've been studying for years now the introduction of technologies like social, mobile, analytics, cloud, the internet of things. We call this SMACIT. And here is what you need to understand about SMACIT. It is changing what's possible. And why we care about this is because it's not just SMACIT, but this constant introduction of new technologies. Add artificial intelligence, blockchain, biometrics, robotics, quantum computing, they just keep coming. And they are changing what's possible in business in ways that Uber made so evident when it said, people don't just want a ride in a car. They want an information enriched travel experience. They want a solution to their transportation needs. This is what digital is doing to business. Now the good news is you do not have to understand every new technology and what it makes possible as it arrives on the scene. What you can do is simply recognize that technology has gone from an enabler to a source of inspiration for your business strategy. We suggest that you allow yourself to be inspired by three capabilities that extend across all these digital technologies.",
  "The first is ubiquitous data. There is basically nothing you can't know now. The data is out there. You're looking for ways to find it and use it. So stop thinking of data as a limitation, and think of all it makes possible. Then find the way to get the data and to get permission to use that data. ",
  'The second capability is unlimited connectivity. Particularly IoT and mobile are making it possible to learn things immediately and then do something about them immediately. People recognize what that connectivity means in terms of what we need to be delivering and imagining for our customers. ',
  'Finally, there is massive processing power. There is no limit to how much data you can process. So what you can imagine, you can do. That is the challenge of digital.',
  "Now what's interesting to us is that as we study the possibilities here, it's been clear that companies were indeed responding. They were not all doing so in the same way. They, in fact, didn't mean the same thing when they told us they were digitally transforming. What we went out to study, then, is what is a digital transformation? And what you need to understand about what we learned is that there's actually two pieces of this. And even now when everybody is working from home, and people are saying to us, well, we just became digital. Not so fast. Working from home under duress is not the same as being a digital company. There are two ways of thinking about this transformation. The first is that it leads to digitization. This is about operational excellence. This is about end-to-end delivery, doing things for your customers in ways that simply work, regardless of channel. So they can call you on the phone. They can chat with you on the internet. They can do things for themselves through an app. But the idea is you are operationally excellent, and thus you can anticipate your needs. You can address their needs as they arrive. You do better what you have always done. You deliver traditional products and services, but you deliver them at a level that was not possible before. We call that digitizing. And the reason this is important is because digital technologies are raising the bar. You really must be digitized. But that is only half the story. ",
  "The other half of the story is becoming digital. This is about rapid business innovation. It involves delivering brand new customer value propositions. These are the solutions that Uber has made so visible. What problems can you solve for your customers that you never considered part of your mandate before? Move beyond your traditional products and services, and solve your customer's problems. That is the challenge of digital. Digitizing, getting better and better at what you've always done and becoming digital, delivering brand new customer solutions. I think this is a good time to just learn a little about the companies out in our audience. So we're going to ask a polling question here. We'd like to know what digital transformation means to your company. Is it digitizing, becoming more operationally excellent at what you've always done? Or is it about digital, delivering rapid business innovation? Or is it neither or both? ",
  "What is digital to your company? Can we have the polling question, please? So if you'll pick one of those options, digitized only, digital only, neither, or both, we'll get a sense of what's going on here. Here we go. So as you can see, the majority of companies in our webinar here are trying to do both. It doesn't get much harder than that. I appreciate the importance of digitized only, and if you have the luxury of time, that's not a bad way to go. So glad to see that you're all working so hard to try to make progress. Let's talk about these two things that so many of you are trying to do. Here's your challenge. ",
  "It turns out that for the last, oh, 30 or 40 years, we have been using information technology to support our organizational process. The problem is we did it little bit by little bit. And as a result, we ended up with a lot of siloed systems that address one very specific business need. I'm showing five of those very specific needs that were addressed by a system and a company process and the data it generated, the technology it relied on. This is five. We talked with many companies that would say, we have about 2,000 of those. And this is what we created. The problem, of course, is that while it made sense at the time this new system was created, having hundreds or thousands of these siloed systems eventually created more and more demands to connect them. People would go to their IT units and they'd say, well, can't you make that system talk to that system, or share that data with that data? And so we got all these wires I'm showing in here. Sometimes they were, in fact, things the IT unit did. Sometimes they were people downloading things into spreadsheets. Sometimes they were just heroes in your company that would see something going wrong, and they would go out and take care of it. But it doesn't matter how you solve that problem. The solution itself was also a problem. And now what we have is this mess of spaghetti. This is what we're trying to fix right now as we digitize. Because we are indeed exposing all this spaghetti to our customers. So we're trying to create something that looks more like this, a platform. We call it an operational backbone. This is what digitizing is all about. It takes our core operations, and it says we can expose them to customers because they work end to end. They allow us to complete transactions, to get visibility into those transactions, to do all the back office stuff that needs to get done, and it simply works. So this operational backbone is that set of standardized business processes that supports your core transactions and your core back office processes in a seamless way. And that allows you to add front ends, like apps and browser interfaces with your customers. This is the digital platform, an operational backbone. Not everything you do is part of your operational backbone. That's fine. But core is. This is what allows seamlessness and visibility to your customers. ",
  "I just want to describe to you one example of a company that gets it, and that would be Nordstrom. We started studying Nordstrom about five years ago, because they were so tuned into what it was going to take to succeed as a retailer in a digital world. Their business strategy was to recognize that some of their customers-- if any of you don't know Nordstrom, this is a high end retailer, mostly clothing. And for 100 years, the company was retail stores. But what it started doing more than 10 years ago now was recognizing not everybody would want to go into a high end retail store. Some people would want to do things online. Some people would want to do things at a discount. So for years, now, it has been creating its Rack stores with the off price. It's creating Nordstrom.com and allowing customers to do things online. But around 2015, it actually shared with its investors its vision of becoming a digitized company. And what it pursued at that point was a set of capabilities that would allow a customer to use all of its outlets, its off price, its full price, its online its in-store. And it said, what we're going to do is continue to specialize in service. We are known for customer service. We're going to get better and better customer service. We're going to create digital capabilities to support our people who are supporting our customers. But we're also going to allow customers to do things for themselves. So they emphasized the customer service element of this. They took a serious look at their product. But this last piece, the capabilities piece, was about ensuring that technology would service their employees and their customers. And this really paid off. This goes all the way back to 1998 when they created Nordstrom.com, which, at the time, of course, like everybody's was kind of a static page. But they started to build capabilities into Nordstrom.com so people could order online, so that they could take advantage of a back end where they could do store to store fulfill. ",
  "This operational backbone is essential. We call it here in this slide table stakes. And to be honest, we do not know how you become a great digital company. If your core operations are broken, you have to fix them. And this is why we consider this data on the relative dearth of operational backbones to be alarming. This could sink you in your efforts. So it's important to get started. You can do that by not trying to boil the ocean, but by finding the most important data, the most important process, and fix it. Do something that will make a difference in three months, even though fully realizing what you're trying to do will certainly take longer. These operational backbones are challenges that have been created through years and years and years of processes and systems that need to slowly be fixed. So focus on the most important. Do something substantive, and then start to use it. And then the job will never be done. You'll continue that journey for a long, long time. But that is only half the story. In addition to digitizing, you have to become digital because your customers are demanding so much more. You need to start solving their problems. Now to do that, you have to think of your new value proposition. What is it a customer wants from you? This will manifest in digital offering. A digital offering, you'll see here, is an information-enriched solution that engages customers in a seamless, personalized experience. ",
  "It has to be information enriched, because it has to take advantage of these new digital technologies, of the data that's available to them and the speed and connectivity that they make possible. But it also has to be seamless and personalized, because otherwise somebody else is going to come along and take your great idea and do it better. Now this graphic is probably the single most important graphic in this presentation. And it looks ridiculously simple, but it's incredibly hard. There are two things going on here. One is you're trying to be inspired by what digital technologies make possible. And the thing is, they make a lot of things possible. MIT students come to me every day with things that digital technologies are making possible. Here's the problem. Nobody wants to pay for most of that. And if nobody wants to pay for them, it's not really that brilliant. Now your risk here is you're going to think you're some kind of Steve Jobs, and you know better than your customer what they want. Do not make that mistake. You do not know better than your customer, what they want, even if it's true that your customer doesn't know what they want. And that probably is true, but you and your customer are going to learn together what your customer wants. I think that GE experience here is sobering. I mean, the industrial internet, which is what GE envisioned, was a brilliant concept. It was brilliant. The problem was after the company had spent several years and a billion dollars developing it, it then took it to customers and they went, you know? That's not quite what I had in mind. And we can't do that. We can't invest huge sums in a solution that the customer isn't bought into, even if it's good for them. So the other half of this picture is what your customer desires. Now you can influence that. You can market. You can test with them. This idea of ongoing testing. Now let me try this with you. Wouldn't you be interested in is? Here's something that you might like. Amazon, of course, does this all the time, and we're all jealous because they have such huge volume. They can test things all the time. But every company can identify what's possible and test it with real customers, and it is the only way to market. We have to understand we do not know what our customers want. So these two pieces come together day in and day out by trying things and learning and working hand in glove with our customers. That is the challenge of digital. Now I want to share with you three companies that kind of get it. I'll start with Amazon, because we all know Amazon. You might think they're not really fair, because they didn't start as a digital company. But here's the interesting thing. They are not a digital startup. They were born in the 1990s before digital technologies were available. They were born as an online book retailer. You could order a book through an email interface, and they would ship it to you. So what happened is that Amazon has continuously been inspired by technology. When it saw that robotics was possible, it got better and better at warehouse management to where it didn't have to restrict itself to books. When it saw the possibilities of social media, it said, why are we paying people to write a few book reviews? Why don't we have everybody writing reviews and let people pick and choose which reviews they find valuable? When they saw the browser, that was the initial manifestation of moving from an email retailer to an online company that invented the shopping cart, an online virtual shopping experience. Now, as you know, Amazon is inspired by artificial intelligence and better data analytics that help recognize how to recommend products to you and help you decide what it is you want to buy. This is a company that's been inspired. One of its digital offerings is Prime. Now this is like the digital offering of all digital offerings. Most of you are probably customers, probably pay for Prime every year. Do you even know what you pay for Prime? Do you fully understand all the benefits of Prime? Probably not. But do you ever say, do I want to spend the money this year? Probably not. That is the kind of digital offering we all aspire to. We can't-- your customer cannot live without it. That is what we can do with a great digital offering. It so solves the customer problem, they can't even imagine life without it. That's your challenge as you formulate your digital offering. Now let me take an older company. Schneider Electric's been around for well over 100 years, and what it did for most of those 100 years was sell electrical equipment, engineer and sell electrical equipment. And what this does is it enables you, as a builder, to buy things from Schneider. And you can buy everything soup to nuts. You can buy big transformers and switchboards. You can buy the control panel that regulates your temperature. You can buy cords and an outlet. It's soup to nuts. It's all electrical equipment. But what Schneider started to recognize a number of years ago was that with the big equipment, it's good to have alerts if they're failing, if too much is being demanded of them and they no longer have the capacity. And what they were doing was alerting the customer and the salesperson to basically stimulate a new sale. But that recognition that that worked created additional ideas and the opportunity for additional services. What Schneider does now is it creates intelligent energy management solutions. This means that they help you recognize how to source energy. They tell you if you're at risk of having a brown out. They tell you if something's dying. They're looking for ways for you to save money as you provide the energy needs of your business. It started with energy needs for companies like Hilton Hotels who are trying to manage all of the energy requirements for their hotels. But they have also done this for data centers, for office space. They help you through the use of a dashboard understand how you can provide reliable, cost effective energy for your company. What they now sell is what they call EcoStruxure. That's their underlying base for delivering energy solutions to your company. And they have multiple offerings, depending on your particular industry. ",
  "A digital platforms consist of a software solution that enriches your traditional products and services. So you'll want to build these software components in an entirely new environment, in what we call the digital platform. This digital platform is made of reusable components. Some of these are business components. At Schneider, for example, they had to learn how to do subscription billing. This subscription billing was brand new. They never did that before. They built it as a reusable component. So as they're adding new solutions, they can reuse it or tweak it. They can take part of it and not the rest of it. But they don't have to change their entire operational backbone where transactions are normally completed. They also had to create dashboards. That's a reusable component. Even those that use dashboards are customized. But there are a lot of algorithms that go into those. There's asset management. We have to make sure that we're collecting all the data from one of our customer's equipment and none of the data from other customers is entering into the assessment when customers need. So this identity management, asset management becomes really important. That capability gets built in to infrastructure services, many of which are purchased through vendors and cloud services. Some of them are data components that become available by buying, by collecting data from IoT, by borrowing data from their customer backbone. Those data components then serve these business components, and the digital offerings at the top of this picture, are the unique code. For each offering, we have unique code that accesses the reusable components and delivers an actual solution to an actual customer. It's unclear how many of these you might have. But that number can grow and grow because the components themselves are well defined, or reused in what the company has decided is it's value proposition to customers. Now here's the story on the digital platform. Three years ago when we asked how many of you have digital platforms, only 5% of established companies had platforms had started to create repositories of digital components. The good news is we don't have a horrible legacy here. So as we start doing it, it may be small but that platform grows rapidly. I am very confident that this data we collected two years ago is out of date now. This would be significantly different, unlike like the operational backbone where that data is moving very slowly. So here we see new companies recognizing the importance of digital platforms and starting to build them. But this is what it takes to create digital offering. Now understand what this means for any existing company is that you're going to need two technology environments. One is this digital platform where you're creating these reusable components that build your solution. Say they allow for rapid development. They allow you to say, oops. That's not working and get rid of things really quickly. That's your digital platform. You still need this operational backbone. That's how you know your customers. It's how your back office processes work. That's your supply chain for your physical products and services. It's really important. These two platforms do tend to rely on one another for data. We have identified the most progressive companies as doing a remarkable job of allowing people to operate in one environment or the other, and then having a small technology team in between managing what we call the API linkages. You might call it the middle ware. You might call it the data that needs to be exchanged. This is how these two environments can coexist. They allow you-- for all you who said we're doing both right now, digitizing and digital. if you separated responsibility and you have some parts of the business, probably the bigger part of the business, on the operational backbone, other people can start working on those digital offerings in the digital platform. So this is the environment that we think you need to create. I know we don't have a lot of time, Cynthia. But if there's a question or two, we could actually manage a question about this double technology platform. And here's your problem. For years if you were company of any size at all, when you wanted to accomplish something you turned to structure. You said, well, we'll create a new business unit. Or we'll insert a new line of management, or we'll do this matrix that goes across the silos that we've created. We structured. The problem is structure stabilizes. And we are in a world in which our digital offerings are unpredictable. We have to be identifying and responding to emerging customer needs. We all know our customers don't know what they want. We're going to try to help them figure that out and then simultaneously deliver. We're not going to do it with a matrix hierarchy of a company. Too slow. What we'll do instead is something like this. This image is from Spotify. It's a widely circulated on the web, so I thought I would use it. It is old. It's from 2012. So I'm pretty sure Spotify would say, well, we don't quite look like that anymore. And the reason they wouldn't look like that is because what we've learned about these environments is they change rapidly. You learn something. You adapt. Your customer needs change, you adapt. You find a new opportunity, you adapt. ",
  "So how you design your company is constantly evolving. It's a learning process. what works? But the idea is you are relying on empowered teams. You're distributing decision making so people can get stuff done. And they can learn from what they get done, and they can build on it or trash it, depending on what they learn. That is the single hardest part. All the other stuff is hard. This is the single hardest part. Usually the first team isn't so hard. Even the second team isn't so bad. It's when you get to three, four, or five that you start to realize, this is actually pretty hard. Because we want everybody empowered, but we don't want them all just going rogue and doing whatever strikes them as a good idea. That is a good way to waste money. So what we're looking for is continuous learning about how we're going to get better and better and better. In this Spotify picture, you'll see they started-- they move from just some teams to tribes. They would have a tribe that was responsible for free radio. They'd have a tribe that's responsible for core infrastructure. So they have multiple tribes that actually do have some interdependencies. And the important thing is that the tribes recognize their interdependencies and respond to one another's needs. This is why they have things like guilds and chapters that work across teams and across tribes. That's the challenge you'll take on as you start to use empowered people and teams to ensure you're learning and responding to new customer demands. It's hard work, and it starts on the digital side of your business. Ultimately, it's also applicable to the operational backbone side. But it is so essential on the digital side that you really want to make sure you're trying it here, and then implementing it as you can on the operational backbone side. I would say there are eight principles that you're trying to get your head around here. One is as you start to do this, you want to recognize you need people to own your major components and offerings. Past projects where somebody says, I'll deliver something and then hand it off. You want people who are learning, doing, improving, getting rid of, doing whatever needs to be done so that some offering to a customer gets better and better and better and richer and richer. If it gets too big, it'll become two offerings and you'll have more owners owning different parts of those offerings. ",
  "Now what this means is you have to be able to continuously release. This is a new technology environment, and it's why you are likely to do this on the digital side before you get around to the digitized side. This is about what we call DevOps. It's an environment in which people are empowered to put their code into production. And you need a well designed infrastructure for that. So doing this for your digital offerings, which will be much smaller initially, makes a lot of sense. You can eventually go back and make sure this happens with your digitized side. Then you have to understand that this is not the cheapest organizational design. You have to resource it. Otherwise, you have people waiting for stuff, just like you've been waiting for approvals in your hierarchical environment. You're going to end up having this waiting time while people are waiting for people to get stuff done. You rely on collaboration, not hierarchy to ensure that people get stuff done. And you make sure that leaders trust the decision makers. If you empower people but you don't trust their decisions, you have not really empowered them. This is about assigning accountability. You tell someone you trust them, that they can deliver. You're constantly working with them to clarify what it is their mission should accomplish. You're challenging their ideas. You're testing why they want to pursue a certain experiment. This is about learning to coach instead of direct. This is hard. And people tell us the hard part is not the empowered team part. You'll find people perfectly capable there. It's the next layer up, people who are capable of coaching, or moving talent, of identifying missions that are really clear. That is the real challenge here, and it is why this is even harder than the technology environments you're trying to create. So let's stop here for our second polling question. We need to do this real quickly. So if you can bring that question up. When you look at this, these principles for accountability and the need to empower, what would you say is true of your company? What percentage has been designed for accountability rather than structured for delegated activities? Is it less than 10%, 11% to 25%, 26% to 50%, more than 50%? And I ask you all to go ahead and fill that in. Pick one of those choices. Now let's go ahead and look at the results here. Oh, they're all over. This is very interesting. So we have slightly more in the 11% to 25% apparently, but they're close. So you can see. Some companies just getting started, some having been at this a while. Those might be smaller companies. I am not able to ask, but that is-- that's our pursuit. That's what we're trying to do. We're trying to run our companies through empowerment. So let me wrap up now by giving you the really bad news. So it's not that this is hard. Of course it's hard, but you're all up for that. The thing is it's slow. There is so much learning as you learn to assign accountabilities, as you learn to build a digital platform, as you learn what your customers want, that what we've observed from the companies we've studied is there is no way to become digital rapidly. You'll see that the hypothetical we've grown here is that, well, if your revenues, your traditional revenues, are over time going to diminish, which is true for a lot of companies. The good news is you'll have these digital revenues coming in, the orange line here. But it takes a number of years to go from 0 to something substantive. On average, 5% of a company's revenues-- and we're talking companies that have digital offering. The report we got is on average 5% of their revenues are from those digital offerings. That's slow. And it's not going to change overnight, unless, of course, that's exactly the impact a pandemic has. We'll be studying that. What we have learned is you're going to have to allow some time for learning. ",
